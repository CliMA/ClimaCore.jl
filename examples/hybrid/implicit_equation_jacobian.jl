    ImplicitEquationJacobian(Y, transform, [flags])

Represents the Jacobian of the implicit residual, `R(Y)`, which is defined as
either `Yᵖʳᵉᵛ + δt * γ * Yₜ - Y` or `(Y - Yᵖʳᵉᵛ) / (δt * γ) - Yₜ`, with the
second version used when `transform` is `true`. In this expression, `δt` is the
timestep, `γ` is a scalar quantity determined by the timestepping scheme, `Y` is
the current approximation of the timestepper's implicit stage value, `Yₜ` is the
value obtained by calling `implicit_tendency!(Yₜ, Y, p, t)`, and `Yᵖʳᵉᵛ` is a
linear combination of the timestepper's previous stage values. The residual's
Jacobian, `∂R/∂Y`, can be expressed in terms of the tendency's Jacobian,
`∂Yₜ/∂Y`, as either `δt * γ * ∂Yₜ/∂Y - I` or `I / (δt * γ) - ∂Yₜ/∂Y`.

The `ImplicitEquationJacobian` allows the `staggered_nonhydrostatic_model.jl` 
file to be compatible with `ClimaTimeSteppers` and `OrdinaryDiffEq`. This file
defines both `implicit_tendency!` and `implicit_equation_jacobian!`, where the
latter sets `∂R/∂Y` based on the values of `Y` and `δt * γ`. An optional set of
flags can also be passed to the `ImplicitEquationJacobian` constructor, which
are then accessible from within `implicit_equation_jacobian!`. For all
timestepping schemes from `ClimaTimeSteppers` and the Rosenbrock schemes from
`OrdinaryDiffEq`, the `transform` flag should be set to `false`. For all other
timestepping schemes from `OrdinaryDiffEq`, it should be set to `true`.

Within both `ClimaTimeSteppers` and `OrdinaryDiffEq`, this data structure is
used to solve the linear equation `∂R/∂Y * δY = R`, which allows Newton's method
to iteratively find the root of `R(Y) = 0`. In `ClimaTimeSteppers`, this is done
by calling `ldiv!(δY, ∂R/∂Y, R)`, where `δY` and `R` are represeted as
`FieldVector`s and `∂R/∂Y` is represented as an `ImplicitEquationJacobian`. When
using Krylov methods from `ClimaTimeSteppers`, `δY` and `R` can also be
represented as other `AbstractVector`s (which are internally converted to
`FieldVector`s). For `OrdinaryDiffEq`, we use the `linsolve!` function instead
of `ldiv!` by passing it to the timestepping scheme's constructor.

TODO: Compatibility with `OrdinaryDiffEq` is out of date and should be updated.
