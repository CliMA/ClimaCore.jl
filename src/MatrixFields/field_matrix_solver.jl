A `FieldMatrixSolverAlgorithm` for a block diagonal matrix:

\\mathbf{0} &      A_{22} & \\mathbf{0} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\

\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} & \\cdots &      A_{NN}
\\end{bmatrix}
```
This algorithm solves the `N` block equations `Aₙₙ * xₙ = bₙ` in sequence (though
we might want to parallelize it in the future).

If `Aₙₙ` is a diagonal matrix, the equation `Aₙₙ * xₙ = bₙ` is solved by making a
single pass over the data, setting each `xₙ[i]` to `inv(Aₙₙ[i, i]) * bₙ[i]`.

Otherwise, the equation `Aₙₙ * xₙ = bₙ` is solved using Gaussian elimination
(without pivoting), which makes two passes over the data. This is currently only
implemented for tri-diagonal and penta-diagonal matrices `Aₙₙ`. In Gaussian
elimination, `Aₙₙ` is effectively factorized into the product `Lₙ * Dₙ * Uₙ`,
where `Dₙ` is a diagonal matrix, and where `Lₙ` and `Uₙ` are unit lower and upper
triangular matrices, respectively. The first pass multiplies both sides of the
equation by `inv(Lₙ * Dₙ)`, replacing `Aₙₙ` with `Uₙ` and `bₙ` with `Uₙxₙ`, which
is referred to as putting `Aₙₙ` into "reduced row echelon form". The second pass
solves `Uₙ * xₙ = Uₙxₙ` for `xₙ` with a unit upper triangular matrix solver, which
is referred to as "back substitution". These operations can become numerically
unstable when `Aₙₙ` has entries with large disparities in magnitude, but avoiding
this would require swapping the rows of `Aₙₙ` (i.e., replacing `Dₙ` with a
partial pivoting matrix).

3. Solve `A₁₁ * x₁ = b₁ - A₁₂ * x₂` for `x₁` using the algorithm `alg₁`.

Since `A₁₁` is not necessarily a diagonal matrix, `inv(A₁₁)` will generally be a
dense matrix, which means that the Schur complement of `A₁₁` in `A`,
`A₂₂ - A₂₁ * inv(A₁₁) * A₁₂`, cannot be computed efficiently. So, `alg₂` must be

complement matrix. This involves representing the Schur complement matrix by a

the matrix-vector product.

This algorithm is equivalent to block Gaussian elimination, where steps 1 and 2
put `A` into reduced row echelon form, and step 3 performs back substitution.
