"""Flag square brackets that Documenter will parse as a markdown link.

Documenter parses ``[text](target)`` as a link. Its parser is more permissive
than CommonMark: **any** run of whitespace between the closing bracket and the
opening parenthesis still forms a link, including a line break. So all four of
these become links whose destination is the parenthetical text, and the docs
build fails with a ``:cross_references`` error:

    Density [kg/m³](as measured at cloud base).
    Density [kg/m³] (as measured at cloud base).
    Density [kg/m³]  (as measured at cloud base).
    Density [kg/m³]
    (as measured at cloud base).

Separating the two with punctuation, or wrapping the units in backticks, is
safe:

    Density [kg/m³], as measured at cloud base.
    Density [kg/m³]. (As measured at cloud base.)
    Density `[kg/m³]` (as measured at cloud base).

This matters even for docstrings that no page renders today: `docs/make.jl`
uses ``checkdocs = :exports``, so an unrendered docstring's broken link stays
latent until someone adds that symbol to a page, and the build then fails in a
seemingly unrelated PR.

Usage:
    .dev/check_markdown_link_ambiguity.py [paths...]

With no arguments, scans `src/` and `docs/src/`. Exits non-zero if any
ambiguity is found.

Only prose is scanned: docstring bodies in `.jl`, and in `.md` everything
outside fenced blocks. Julia code, code comments, ``` and ~~~ fences, and
`inline code spans` are all skipped, so array indexing such as `a[i](x)`, and
documentation that deliberately quotes the bad pattern as an example, do not
produce false positives.
