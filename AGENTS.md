# AGENTS.md

Read these documents in the order listed when starting work on this repository.

## Before you act: agent autonomy

Before making changes that are externally visible or scientifically consequential (`git push`, version bumps, reproducibility-test edits, CI config changes, public API renames), check [docs/dev-guides/workflow/agent_autonomy.md](docs/dev-guides/workflow/agent_autonomy.md). The boundaries listed there require explicit user approval.

## Shared guides (via DeveloperGuides subtree)

The shared engineering guidelines are vendored as a Git subtree at `docs/dev-guides/`. Julia's `Pkg` does not resolve git submodules, so subtree is the standard mechanism across the CliMA ecosystem. The full index lives at [docs/dev-guides/AGENTS.md](docs/dev-guides/AGENTS.md). Start there for:
- Architecture, design patterns, and cross-repo contracts
- GPU performance, type stability, and AD compatibility
- Code style, testing, and PR review

Edits to shared guidelines belong in [CliMA/DeveloperGuides](https://github.com/CliMA/DeveloperGuides), not in the vendored copy here. A scheduled workflow (`.github/workflows/update_dev_guides.yml`) syncs the subtree monthly.

## Repo-specific guide

- [docs/clima_core_specific.md](docs/clima_core_specific.md) — directory layout, key abstractions, test groups, and conventions specific to this package.
