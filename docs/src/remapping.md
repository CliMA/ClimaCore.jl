# Remapping to regular grids

`ClimaCore` horizontal domains are spectral elements. Points are not distributed
uniformly within an element, and elements are also not necessarily organized in
a simple way. For these reasons, remapping to regular grids becomes a
fundamental operations when inspecting the simulation output. In this section,
we describe the remappers currently available in `ClimaCore`.

Broadly speaking, we can classify remappers in two categories: conservative, and
non-conservative. Conservative remappers preserve areas (and masses) when
interpolating from the spectral grid to Cartesian ones. Conservative remappers
are non-local operations (meaning that they require communication between
different elements) and are more expensive, so they are typically reserved to
operations where physical conservation is important (e.g., exchange between
component models in a coupled simulation). On the other hand, non-conservative
remappers are local to an element and faster to evaluate, which makes them
suitable to operations like diagnostics and plotting, where having perfect
physical conservation is not as important.

## Non-conservative remapping

Non-conservative remappers are fast and do not require communication, but they
are not as accurate as conservative remappers, especially with large elements
with sharp gradients. These remappers are better suited for diagnostics and
plots.

The main non-conservative remapper currently implemented utilizes a Lagrange
interpolation with the barycentric formula in [Berrut2004], equation (3.2), for
the horizontal interpolation. Vertical interpolation is linear except in the
boundary elements where it is 0th order.

### Quick start

Assuming you have a `ClimaCore` `Field` with name `field`, the simplest way to
interpolate onto a uniform grid is with
```julia
julia> import ClimaCore.Remapping
julia> Remapping.interpolate(field)
```

This will return an `Array` (or a `CuArray`) with the `field` interpolated on
some uniform grid that is automatically determined based on the `Space` of the
given `field`. To obtain such coordinates, you can call the
`Remapping.default_target_hcoords` and `Remapping.default_target_zcoords`
functions. These functions return an `Array` with the coordinates over which
interpolation will occur. These arrays are of type `Geometry.Point`s.

`ClimaCore.Remapping.interpolate` allocates new output arrays. As such, it is
not suitable for performance-critical applications.
`ClimaCore.Remapping.interpolate!` performs interpolation in-place. When using
the in-place version`, the `dest`ination has to have the same array type as the
device in use (e.g., `CuArray` for CUDA runs) and has to be `nothing` for
non-root processes. For performance-critical applications, it is preferable to a
`ClimaCore.Remapping.Remapper` and use it directly (see next Section).

#### Example

Given `field`, a `Field` defined on a cubed sphere.

By default, a target uniform grid is chosen (with resolution `hresolution` and
`vresolution`), so remapping is
```julia
interpolated_array = interpolate(field, hcoords, zcoords)
```
Coordinates can be specified:

```julia
longpts = range(-180.0, 180.0, 21)
latpts = range(-80.0, 80.0, 21)
zpts = range(0.0, 1000.0, 21)

hcoords = [Geometry.LatLongPoint(lat, long) for long in longpts, lat in latpts]
zcoords = [Geometry.ZPoint(z) for z in zpts]

interpolated_array = interpolate(field, hcoords, zcoords)
```
The output is defined on the Cartesian product of `hcoords` with `zcoords`.

If the default target coordinates are being used, it is possible to broadcast
`ClimaCore.Geometry.components` to extract them as a vector of tuples (and then
broadcast `getindex` to extract the respective coordinates as vectors).

### The `Remapper` object

A `Remapping.Remapper` is an object that is tied to a specified `Space` and can
interpolate scalar `Field`s defined on that space onto a predefined target grid.
The grid does not have to be regular, but it has to be defined as a Cartesian
product between some horizontal and vertical coordinates (meaning, for each
horizontal point, there is a fixed column of vertical coordinates).

Let us create our first remapper, assuming we have `space` defined on the surface of the sphere
```julia
import ClimaCore.Geometry: LatLongPoint, ZPoint
import ClimaCore.Remapping: Remapper

hcoords = [Geometry.LatLongPoint(lat, long) for long in -180.:180., lat in -90.:90.]
remapper = Remapper(space, target_hcoords)
```
This `remapper` object knows can interpolate `Field`s defined on `space` with the same `interpolate` and `interpolate!` functions.
```julia
import ClimaCore.Fields: coordinate_field
import ClimaCore.Remapping: interpolate, interpolate!

example_field = coordinate_field(space)
interpolated_array = interpolate(remapper, example_field)

# Interpolate in place
interpolate!(interpolated_array, remapper, example_field)
```

Multiple fields defined on the same space can be interpolate at the same time
```julia
example_field2 = cosd.(example_field)
interpolated_arrays = interpolate(remapper, [example_field, example_field2])
```

When interpolating multiple fields, greater performance can be achieved by
creating the `Remapper` with a larger internal buffer to store intermediate
values for interpolation. Effectively, this controls how many fields can be
remapped simultaneously in `interpolate`. When more fields than `buffer_length`
are passed, the remapper will batch the work in sizes of `buffer_length`. The optimal number of fields passed is the `buffer_length` of the `remapper`. If
more fields are passed, the `remapper` will batch work with size up to its
`buffer_length`.

#### Example

Given `field1`,`field2`, two `Field` defined on a cubed sphere.

```julia
longpts = range(-180.0, 180.0, 21)
latpts = range(-80.0, 80.0, 21)
zpts = range(0.0, 1000.0, 21)

hcoords = [Geometry.LatLongPoint(lat, long) for long in longpts, lat in latpts]
zcoords = [Geometry.ZPoint(z) for z in zpts]

space = axes(field1)

remapper = Remapper(space, hcoords, zcoords)

int1 = interpolate(remapper, field1)
int2 = interpolate(remapper, field2)

# Or
int12 = interpolate(remapper, [field1, field2])
# With int1 = int12[1, :, :, :]
```
