# Operators

```@meta
CurrentModule = ClimaCore.Operators

_Operators_ can compute spatial derivative operations.

 - for performance reasons, we need to be able to "fuse" multiple operators and
 function applications
 - Julia provides a tool for this: **broadcasting**, with a very flexible API

Can think of operators are "pseudo-functions": can't be called directly, but
act similar to functions in the context of broadcasting. They are matrix-free,
in the sense that we define the _action_ of the operator directly on a field,
without explicitly assembling the matrix representing the discretized operator.

## Finite difference operators

Finite difference operators are similar with some subtle differences:
- they can change staggering (center to face, or vice versa)
- they can span multiple elements
  - no DSS is required
  - boundary handling may be required

We use the following convention:
 - centers are indexed by integers `1, 2, ..., n`
 - faces are indexed by half integers `half, 1+half, ..., n+half`
