# Motivation and Benefits
A "white paper" that briefly mentions all the nice properties of the library:  extensibility, composability, ease-of-use, library-reuse, (performance-portability?), (scalability?). This will give ClimaCore its proper DOI and citability tool.

# Costs
From JOSS' [website](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#submitting-a-paper-to-joss): "If youâ€™ve already developed a fully featured research code, released it under an OSI-approved license, and written good documentation and tests, then we expect that it should take perhaps an hour or two to prepare and submit your paper to JOSS. But please read these instructions carefully for a streamlined submission."

# Tentative TODOs
Improve Docs:
- [x] Getting started/How to guide
- [x] Contributing guide + Authorship policy + Code of Conduct (?)
- [ ] Examples documentation (equations set, what to expect from each example, artifacts, if included)


Improve Unit Tests:
- [ ] Unit tests: strive for best code coverage: e.g., double check that all operators are tested


Performance:
- [ ] Distributed computing capability (probably no need for scaling studies)
- [ ] Multi-threading capability (might include initial GPU support?)
